This is a web application created with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) stack that serves as an internal talent directory.

This application is intended to be used by a company to help former employees find new employment opportunites and help partnering company recruiters find talent from 
a company they trust. Many people have been impacted by the pandemic and some companies are doing more than others to help their affected employees. This would aid those seeking 
new employment and reduce the time to securing new employment. 

Sample page: https://talent-connector.netlify.app/ (The front-end is hosted on Netlify and the back-end is hosted on Heroku. The server data on the talent and partner page may
take up to 30 seconds to load if the page has not been accessed for a while because of how Heroku works)
